There may be some problems with scaling, especially with smaller maps. In the .json file there is a "scale", which is the number of pixels each field will take. (For exmple, scale 5 means field 5x5 px). Rather, the problems don't affect the map itself, but rather the text around it. So please, if you want a map with a smaller number of fields, use bigger scaling.
